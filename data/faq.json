			"Rolling filter to select only people that have been subscribed for more than 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 months.",
			"This filter depends on <strong>Subscriber loyality badges</strong>, so don't forget to set them up!",
			"Without loyality badges, you can select <code>1 month</code> as a subscribers only filter."

		"question": "Subscriber luck, how does it work?",
		"answer": [
			"Subscriber luck specifies how many times are subscribers likely to win as opposed to regular users.",

			"<strong><code>*</code></strong> - Only subscribers.",
			"<strong><code>^</code></strong> - Only people who cheered.",
			"For example, searching for <code><strong>*</strong></code> will find all subscribers, and searching for <code><strong>*</strong>foo</code> will find subscribers with name containing <em>foo<em>.",

			"List of all the people you've rolled in the past. The list is persistent (stays between page reloads), but attached to the current browser, so it won't migrate to other machines.",
			"You have 5 MB of storage available, so be sure to keep an eye on the used data statistic (bottom of the list), and clear the oldest records when it start approaching the limit.",
			"5 MB gives you space for 20.000+ records.",

		"question": "It isn't random! Always rolls the same people!",

			"No, the rolling <strong>is</strong> random. The only time rolling prefers some people more than others is when you increase Subscriber luck, which is explained above.",
			"If you <em>\"feel\"</em> that it isn't random, I urge you to test it! Get 10 people in the list, and roll a couple hundred times while writing down the win distribution.",
			"If you still don't believe me, you can always open the <a href=\"https://github.com/darsain/twitch-giveaways\" target=\"_blank\">repository</a> and check the code. Rolling is located in the <code>src/js/component/tga.js</code> file as <code>this.roll()</code> function."
